The Burial of the Dead\\n\\n  April is the cruellest month, breeding\\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing \\nMemory and desire, stirring \\nDull roots with spring rain. \\nWinter kept us warm, covering \\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding \\nA little life with dried tubers. \\nSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee \\nWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, \\nAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, \\nAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour. \\nBin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch. \\nAnd when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s, \\nMy cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, \\nAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie, \\nMarie, hold on tight. And down we went. \\nIn the mountains, there you feel free. \\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. \\n\\n  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow \\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man, \\nYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only \\nA heap of broken images, where the sun beats, \\nAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, \\nAnd the dry stone no sound of water. Only \\nThere is shadow under this red rock, \\n(Come in under the shadow of this red rock), \\nAnd I will show you something different from either \\nYour shadow at morning striding behind you \\nOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you; \\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust. \\n                      Frisch weht der Wind \\n                      Der Heimat zu \\n                      Mein Irisch Kind, \\n                      Wo weilest du? \\n“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; \\n“They called me the hyacinth girl.”\\n—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, \\nYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not \\nSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither \\nLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing, \\nLooking into the heart of light, the silence. \\nOed’ und leer das Meer. \\n\\n  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, \\nHad a bad cold, nevertheless \\nIs known to be the wisest woman in Europe, \\nWith a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, \\nIs your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, \\n(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) \\nHere is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, \\nThe lady of situations. \\nHere is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, \\nAnd here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, \\nWhich is blank, is something he carries on his back, \\nWhich I am forbidden to see. I do not find \\nThe Hanged Man. Fear death by water. \\nI see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. \\nThank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, \\nTell her I bring the horoscope myself: \\nOne must be so careful these days. \\n\\n  Unreal City, \\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn, \\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, \\nI had not thought death had undone so many. \\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, \\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet. \\nFlowed up the hill and down King William Street, \\nTo where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours \\nWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. \\nThere I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson! \\n“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! \\n“That corpse you planted last year in your garden, \\n“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? \\n“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? \\n“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, \\n“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! \\n“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\\n\\n\\n              II. A Game of Chess\\n\\nThe Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, \\nGlowed on the marble, where the glass \\nHeld up by standards wrought with fruited vines \\nFrom which a golden Cupidon peeped out \\n(Another hid his eyes behind his wing) \\nDoubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra \\nReflecting light upon the table as \\nThe glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, \\nFrom satin cases poured in rich profusion; \\nIn vials of ivory and coloured glass \\nUnstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, \\nUnguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused \\nAnd drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air \\nThat freshened from the window, these ascended \\nIn fattening the prolonged candle-flames, \\nFlung their smoke into the laquearia, \\nStirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. \\nHuge sea-wood fed with copper \\nBurned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, \\nIn which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam. \\nAbove the antique mantel was displayed \\nAs though a window gave upon the sylvan scene \\nThe change of Philomel, by the barbarous king \\nSo rudely forced; yet there the nightingale \\nFilled all the desert with inviolable voice \\nAnd still she cried, and still the world pursues, \\n“Jug Jug” to dirty ears. \\nAnd other withered stumps of time \\nWere told upon the walls; staring forms \\nLeaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. \\nFootsteps shuffled on the stair. \\nUnder the firelight, under the brush, her hair \\nSpread out in fiery points \\nGlowed into words, then would be savagely still. \\n\\n  “My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. \\n“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. \\n  “What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? \\n“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”\\n\\n  I think we are in rats’ alley \\nWhere the dead men lost their bones. \\n\\n  “What is that noise?”\\n                          The wind under the door. \\n“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?” \\n                           Nothing again nothing. \\n                                                        “Do \\n“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember \\n“Nothing?”\\n\\n       I remember \\nThose are pearls that were his eyes. \\n“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”   \\n           \\n                                                                           But \\nO O O O that Shakespeherian Rag— \\nIt’s so elegant \\nSo intelligent \\n“What shall I do now? What shall I do?” \\n“I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street \\n“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow? \\n“What shall we ever do?” \\n                                               The hot water at ten. \\nAnd if it rains, a closed car at four. \\nAnd we shall play a game of chess, \\nPressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door. \\n\\n  When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said— \\nI didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself, \\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \\nNow Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart. \\nHe’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you \\nTo get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there. \\nYou have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, \\nHe said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you. \\nAnd no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert, \\nHe’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time, \\nAnd if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said. \\nOh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said. \\nThen I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. \\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \\nIf you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.\\nOthers can pick and choose if you can’t. \\nBut if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling. \\nYou ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. \\n(And her only thirty-one.) \\nI can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face, \\nIt’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. \\n(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.) \\nThe chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same. \\nYou are a proper fool, I said. \\nWell, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said, \\nWhat you get married for if you don’t want children? \\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \\nWell, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, \\nAnd they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot— \\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \\nGoonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight. \\nTa ta. Goonight. Goonight. \\nGood night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night. \\n\\n\\n              III. The Fire Sermon\\n\\n  The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf \\nClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind \\nCrosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. \\nSweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. \\nThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, \\nSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends \\nOr other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. \\nAnd their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; \\nDeparted, have left no addresses. \\nBy the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . . \\nSweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, \\nSweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. \\nBut at my back in a cold blast I hear \\nThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. \\n\\nA rat crept softly through the vegetation \\nDragging its slimy belly on the bank \\nWhile I was fishing in the dull canal \\nOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse \\nMusing upon the king my brother’s wreck \\nAnd on the king my father’s death before him. \\nWhite bodies naked on the low damp ground \\nAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret, \\nRattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year. \\nBut at my back from time to time I hear \\nThe sound of horns and motors, which shall bring \\nSweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. \\nO the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter \\nAnd on her daughter \\nThey wash their feet in soda water \\nEt O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole! \\n\\nTwit twit twit \\nJug jug jug jug jug jug \\nSo rudely forc’d. \\nTereu \\n\\nUnreal City \\nUnder the brown fog of a winter noon \\nMr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant \\nUnshaven, with a pocket full of currants \\nC.i.f. London: documents at sight, \\nAsked me in demotic French \\nTo luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel \\nFollowed by a weekend at the Metropole. \\n\\nAt the violet hour, when the eyes and back \\nTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits \\nLike a taxi throbbing waiting, \\nI Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, \\nOld man with wrinkled female breasts, can see \\nAt the violet hour, the evening hour that strives \\nHomeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, \\nThe typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights \\nHer stove, and lays out food in tins. \\nOut of the window perilously spread \\nHer drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays, \\nOn the divan are piled (at night her bed) \\nStockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. \\nI Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs \\nPerceived the scene, and foretold the rest— \\nI too awaited the expected guest. \\nHe, the young man carbuncular, arrives, \\nA small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare, \\nOne of the low on whom assurance sits \\nAs a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. \\nThe time is now propitious, as he guesses, \\nThe meal is ended, she is bored and tired, \\nEndeavours to engage her in caresses \\nWhich still are unreproved, if undesired. \\nFlushed and decided, he assaults at once; \\nExploring hands encounter no defence; \\nHis vanity requires no response, \\nAnd makes a welcome of indifference. \\n(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all \\nEnacted on this same divan or bed; \\nI who have sat by Thebes below the wall \\nAnd walked among the lowest of the dead.) \\nBestows one final patronising kiss, \\nAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . . \\n\\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass, \\nHardly aware of her departed lover; \\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: \\n“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”\\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly and \\nPaces about her room again, alone, \\nShe smoothes her hair with automatic hand, \\nAnd puts a record on the gramophone. \\n\\n“This music crept by me upon the waters” \\nAnd along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. \\nO City city, I can sometimes hear \\nBeside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, \\nThe pleasant whining of a mandoline \\nAnd a clatter and a chatter from within \\nWhere fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls \\nOf Magnus Martyr hold \\nInexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold. \\n\\n               The river sweats \\n               Oil and tar \\n               The barges drift \\n               With the turning tide \\n               Red sails \\n               Wide \\n               To leeward, swing on the heavy spar. \\n               The barges wash \\n               Drifting logs \\n               Down Greenwich reach \\n               Past the Isle of Dogs. \\n                                 Weialala leia \\n                                 Wallala leialala\\n\\n               Elizabeth and Leicester \\n               Beating oars \\n               The stern was formed \\n               A gilded shell \\n               Red and gold \\n               The brisk swell \\n               Rippled both shores \\n               Southwest wind \\n               Carried down stream \\n               The peal of bells \\n               White towers \\n                                Weialala leia \\n                                Wallala leialala \\n\\n“Trams and dusty trees. \\nHighbury bore me.
