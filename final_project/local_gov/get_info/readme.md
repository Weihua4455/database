using the csv I got from get_link, I will scrape for three files:
  1. leader.info file that contains basic information such as
    
    -name
    
    -url

    -short_bio
    
    -published_date: when was their info published and who published it (人民,新华,etc)
    
    -province: which province they are currently working in
    
    -group: group of leadership
    
    -title: current title
    
  2. leader.resume file that contains information of ... well, each person's resume:
  
    -name
    
    -year: a range of years
    
    -content: what they were doing where
    
    -url
    
  3. problem.leader file that contains name and url that didn't turn back any result
